# Architecture

This document explains how Smart Logging works internally - the agents, data flow, and design decisions.

---

## 🏗️ System Overview

Smart Logging uses a **5-agent multi-agent system** where each agent specializes in one task. Agents pass data through a workflow orchestrated by LangGraph.

```
User Query → Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → Agent 4 → Answer
                ↑                              ↓
                └──────── Agent 5 ←────────────┘
                      (Self-Correction)
```

## 🤖 The 5 Agents

### Agent 1: Retrieve
**Purpose:** Find relevant log chunks using hybrid search

**How it works:**
1. Fetches pod logs via `oc describe pod`
2. Splits logs into 1K character chunks (20% overlap)
3. Searches using:
   - **BM25** (lexical/keyword matching)
   - **FAISS** (semantic similarity with Granite embeddings)
4. Combines results using **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**
5. Returns top 10 relevant chunks

**Why hybrid?**
- BM25 catches exact error codes: "OOMKilled", "CrashLoopBackOff"
- FAISS catches semantic meaning: "out of memory" → relates to "OOMKilled"

**File:** `k8s_hybrid_retriever.py`

---

### Agent 2: Rerank
**Purpose:** Refine results using a specialized reranking model

**How it works:**
1. Takes 10 chunks from Agent 1
2. Sends to BGE Reranker v2-m3
3. Gets better relevance scores
4. Returns top 10 reranked chunks

**Why rerank?**
- Initial retrieval is fast but imprecise
- Reranker is slower but more accurate
- Best of both: fast retrieval + accurate ranking

**File:** `v7_bge_reranker.py`

---

### Agent 3: Grade Documents
**Purpose:** Filter out irrelevant chunks

**How it works:**
1. Takes each chunk from Agent 2
2. Asks LLM: "Is this relevant to the question?"
3. Uses **inclusive philosophy**: "even partial relevance = yes"
4. Keeps only relevant chunks
5. Passes filtered chunks to Agent 4

**Why grade?**
- Prevents garbage information reaching final answer
- Quality > Quantity
- Reduces hallucinations

**Critical Fix:** Shows **full document** to grader (not truncated to 500 chars)

**File:** `v7_graph_nodes.py` (grade_documents method)

---

### Agent 4: Generate Answer
**Purpose:** Create final answer using relevant context

**How it works:**
1. Takes filtered chunks from Agent 3
2. Builds context from all chunks
3. Sends to Llama 3.2 3B with specialized prompt:
   - Check pod status/conditions
   - Check environment variables (Secrets)
   - Check volumes (ConfigMaps)
   - Check events section
4. Formats answer as:
   - 🚨 ISSUE
   - 📋 ROOT CAUSE
   - ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
   - 🔧 RESOLUTION

**Why specialized prompt?**
- Generic prompts miss subtle issues
- OpenShift-specific guidance prevents false negatives
- Structured format ensures complete answers

**File:** `v7_graph_nodes.py` (generate method)

---

### Agent 5: Transform Query
**Purpose:** Rewrite poor queries for better retrieval

**How it works:**
1. If Agent 4's answer quality is low
2. Agent 5 rewrites the original query
3. Makes it more specific (adds keywords, error codes)
4. Loops back to Agent 1 with new query
5. Max 3 iterations to prevent infinite loops

**Example:**
```
Original: "pod problem"
Iteration 1: "pod crash error logs"
Iteration 2: "container exit code CrashLoopBackOff"
→ Better results!
```

**File:** `v7_graph_nodes.py` (transform_query method)

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

```
1. User asks: "What is the issue with pod X?"
           ↓
2. Agent 1: Retrieve
   - Fetch pod logs (oc describe pod X)
   - Chunk into 1K pieces
   - BM25 search: finds chunks with "issue", "error", "failed"
   - FAISS search: finds semantically similar chunks
   - RRF fusion: combines both results
   - Returns top 10 chunks
           ↓
3. Agent 2: Rerank
   - BGE Reranker scores each chunk
   - Reorders by relevance
   - Returns top 10 reranked chunks
           ↓
4. Agent 3: Grade
   - For each chunk:
     * LLM: "Is this relevant?"
     * If yes → keep
     * If no → discard
   - Passes 5-8 relevant chunks
           ↓
5. Agent 4: Generate
   - Reads all relevant chunks
   - Checks pod status, events, env vars, volumes
   - Generates structured answer
   - Quality check: Is answer good?
           ↓
   If YES → Return to user ✅
   If NO  → Go to Agent 5
           ↓
6. Agent 5: Transform (if needed)
   - Rewrite query to be more specific
   - Loop back to Agent 1
   - Try again (max 3 times)
```

## 💾 Data Flow

### Input
```
User Query: "What is the issue?"
Namespace: test-problematic-pods
Pod: missing-config-app-xxx
```

### Processing
```
Step 1: Fetch logs
→ Raw text: 3,000 characters from oc describe pod

Step 2: Chunk
→ 3 chunks of 1,000 chars each

Step 3: Retrieve
→ BM25 scores: [0.85, 0.72, 0.45]
→ FAISS scores: [0.78, 0.81, 0.62]
→ RRF combined: [0.90, 0.88, 0.65]

Step 4: Rerank
→ BGE scores: [0.95, 0.87, 0.71]

Step 5: Grade
→ Chunk 1: Relevant (has Events section)
→ Chunk 2: Relevant (has Environment with Secret)
→ Chunk 3: Not relevant (just metadata)

Step 6: Generate
→ Context: Chunks 1 & 2 (Events + Environment)
→ Analysis: Both ConfigMap AND Secret missing
```

### Output
```
🚨 ISSUE: Multiple missing resources
- Missing ConfigMap: nonexistent-configmap
- Missing Secret: nonexistent-secret

📋 ROOT CAUSE: Pod stuck in ContainerCreating

🔧 RESOLUTION:
oc create configmap nonexistent-configmap --from-literal=...
oc create secret generic nonexistent-secret --from-literal=...
```

## 🎯 Design Decisions

### Why LangGraph?
- **State management**: Passes data between agents
- **Conditional routing**: Can skip or repeat agents
- **Self-correction**: Easy to loop back
- **Observable**: Can debug agent-by-agent

### Why Hybrid Retrieval?
- **BM25**: Fast, exact matches (error codes, pod names)
- **FAISS**: Slower, semantic matches (related concepts)
- **Together**: Best of both worlds

### Why 1K Chunk Size?
- **NVIDIA uses 20K**: Works with their reranker
- **BGE limit is 512 tokens**: ~1,500 chars max
- **Our 1K chunks**: ~250 tokens, well under limit ✅
- **Bonus**: Better granularity (Events/Environment in separate chunks)

### Why Inclusive Grading?
- **Strict grading**: Filters out potentially useful info
- **Inclusive grading**: "When in doubt, keep it"
- **Result**: 50% → 100% detection rate improvement

### Why Full Document to Grader?
- **Before**: Only 500 chars shown → missed Secret at char 600
- **After**: Full document → catches everything
- **Impact**: 80% of the improvement

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Latency Breakdown
```
Agent 1 (Retrieve):  1-2 seconds  (BM25 + FAISS + RRF)
Agent 2 (Rerank):    1-2 seconds  (BGE API call)
Agent 3 (Grade):     1-2 seconds  (5-10 LLM calls)
Agent 4 (Generate):  2-3 seconds  (LLM generation)
Agent 5 (Transform): 0.5 seconds  (if triggered)

Total: 5-10 seconds average
```

### Scalability
- **Single pod**: Handles 10-20 concurrent queries
- **Bottleneck**: LLM inference (Agent 4)
- **Solution**: Scale Llama Stack horizontally

### Accuracy
- **Detection Rate**: 100% (tested on multi-resource issues)
- **False Positives**: <5% (thanks to grading)
- **False Negatives**: ~0% (thanks to inclusive philosophy)
